## About

These Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks were created while I was self-studying Machine Learning and Deep Learning. The primary intention was to develop a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work internally. By building these models from scratch, I could understand the underlying logic of these algorithms.

## Getting Started

To take idea from any of the implementations, simply navigate to the respective directory and view the respective Class code file and `TrainTest` file within each folder.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: NumPy, Scikit-learn
